- 👋 Hi, I’m @D4vRAM and I am a newbie programmer yet!
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, programming, scripts, app development, machine learning, AI, ethical hacking, pentesting, and crypto! I love download, try and to know all kind of apps and software (as much as I can). With Magisk/MagiskDelta/Kitsune or KernelSU you can do GREAT things on an Android phone, and with LSPosed that is a gr8 plus.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly Kotlin and something of Java using AndroidStudio, for Android apps development.
  I'm learning also Python, diving deeper with Bash (fuckin underrated), TypeScript, JavaScript... I also want to create software, for Linux mainly but if is possible compatible for Windows ofc (but yeah, I'm on Team Linux).
  I'm also highly interested in the creation of Magisk and LSPosed modules, is fascinating! But woah, all of these are so many things isn't? So step by step, friends! Being constant, having patience, perserverance, and vocation. That is the key.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects mainly in the future (and also more ambitious goals ofc), but not by now. By the moment I'm learning in an autodidactical way, with my own tempus and my own $PATH (In the future I want the VTs degrees of DAM and DAW, and I will get them).
- 📫 You can reach me over Telegram by the moment, on t.me/D4vRAM369
