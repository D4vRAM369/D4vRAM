- 👋 Hi, I’m @D4vRAM and I am a newbie programmer yet!
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, programming, scripts, app development, machine learning, AI, ethical hacking, pentesting, and crypto! I love download, try and to know all kind of apps and software (as much as I can). With Magisk/MagiskDelta/Kitsune or KernelSU you can do GREAT things on an Android phone, and with LSPosed that is a gr8 plus.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly Kotlin and something of Java using AndroidStudio, for Android apps development.
  I'm learning also Python, diving deeper with Bash (fuckin underrated), TypeScript, JavaScript... I also want to create software, for Linux mainly but if is possible compatible for Windows ofc (but yeah, I'm on Team Linux).
  I'm also highly interested in the creation of Magisk and LSPosed modules, is fascinating! But woah, all of these are so many things isn't? So step by step, friends! Being constant, having patience, perserverance, and vocation. That is the key.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects mainly in the future (and also more ambitious goals ofc), but not by now. By the moment I'm learning in an autodidactical way, with my own tempus and my own $PATH (In the future I want the VTs degrees of DAM and DAW, and I will get them).
- 📫 You can reach me over Telegram by the moment, on t.me/D4vRAM369

UPDATE 15/09/2025

Some time has been pass since the creation of this repo with a presentation README.md

Currently I still learning a lot of things, knowing how to use AI as a kind of professor adapted to you, taking notes and seeing tutorials in YouTube and a lot of resources like PDFs or tools. My favorite study method and most used right now is Project-Based Learning (PBL), which is the way I developed my first two public projects with AI help, and learning meanwhile I create something real and useful for the open source community.

Obviously know the fundamentals of differents languages programming and about programming itself. Of course, that is absolutely esencial to convert yourself with the pass of time, good study and hard work in a good developer. I'm only a newbie programmer yet, and I need study a lot to know how it works everything in the codebase of every project I made, published and not published yet, or without plans to publish some of them.

I'm a neurodivergent mind with a quite probable ADHD not diagnosed yet, and for that reason study only in a conventional way, is a really hard task to me about can keep the focus on it, without getting menntally distracted with my racing thoughts and the brainstorming which lives in my head. My journey to becoming the developer I want to be will be difficult, but nobody said make real your dreams was an easy stuff, right?

My current published projects by now are:

-WhatsMicFix: LSPosed module to improve WhatsApp audio quality by applying a configurable pre-boost to the microphone (tested on Pixel 8, Android 16). Created to solve the annoying problem that many Pixel device users experience, where WhatsApp audio is recorded at low volume. I hope it helps you as much as it helps me!

-NowPlayingExporterPy: Exports the Now Playing history (Android System Intelligence, ASI) from Google Pixel devices to CSV, and adds a function to download the songs listed in that history (via yt-dlp) to the app’s storage.

More project would be published when I finished them totally, and even more projects which lives in my mind and notebooks, but the process to convert them to code and to reality is just a matter of time and learning process. Step by step, like 2Pac said, "One day at a time" 😉🙏🍀💥

Here is my tip jar if you want to contribute to make my life a bit easier in the economical way due my work.
